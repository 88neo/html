In other words, the GDPR is applicable not only for companies in Europe but also for companies all over the world.","faqDesc05":"What is the difference between the GDPR and the previous EU Directive?","faqDesc06":"The previous Directive was a recommended level of regulation while GDPR is a binding law that applies equally to all member states. The GDPR includes new content, such as the designation of a data protection officer (DPO), recording and maintenance of personal information handling history, conducting privacy impact assessments, and strengthening company responsibilities, such as by designating representatives across regions, restrictions on information handling, rights to move information, and the rights of the data subjects.","faqDesc07":"How is the NAVER CLOUD PLATFORM prepared for the GDPR?","faqDesc08":"The NAVER CLOUD PLATFORM has heavily invested in our own regulations and technologies.

Basic Security, Security Monitoring, App Safer, Site Safer, File Safer, Web Security Checker, System Security Checker, App Security Checker, and Cloud Log Analytics","faqDesc11":"What can customers do to prepare for the GDPR?","faqDesc12":"There are three stages you can consider to strategically prepare for the GDPR, depending on whether the GDPR is applicable to you and the time it takes to meet the GDPR compliance standards.<br> Checking the personal information handling process to confirm that it should meet GDPR requirements => If the GDPR is applicable to you, immediately start implementing the GDPR with the ones you apply first => You can consider the procedures for the changes, such as budget and manpower required to perform changes in the internal polices or technical measures (e.g. getting a new process for information handling or collecting evidence).<br> <em><a href=\'https: //www.kisa.or.kr/business/gdpr/gdpr_tab3.jsp\' target=\'_blank\'>https://www.kisa.or.kr/business/gdpr/gdpr_tab3.jsp</a></em><br>  Here are some key factors that can help you meet GDPR compliance:<br>  O Compliance Scope: All organizations established in the EU. Also, organizations established outside of the EU can fall under the scope of the GDPR, depending on their activities.<br> O Key Principles: Understanding the six principles of personal information handling and the six standards to ensure secure handling are required, and you must comply with the responsibility to provide this in a document.<br> O Data Subject Rights: Identifying the flow of privacy data from the business is required and appropriate policy or technological measures must be implemented to exercise information rights, such as data movement rights, and opposing rights.<br> O Controller and Processor: Most of the GDPR is stipulations of obligations, so it is important to identify roles and understand the rules that must be fulfilled for each entity.  We are obligated to comply with designated DPOs, designated representatives, records of personal information handling history, privacy impact assessments,  data protection by design and by default, personal information infringement reports and notifications.<br> O Migration of Personal Information outside the EU: The GDPR permits transfer to other countries if the appropriate level of protection of personal information is ensured.

In such an environment, security and regulatory compliance is a shared responsibility between cloud service providers and customers. This shared model has the added benefit of not only operating infrastructure, but also fewer security and compliance burdens.<br> The same is true of the regulatory environment of the GDPR.
